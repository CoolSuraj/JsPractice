    <p id="demo">This is JS</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.write('Erase all')">Press me</button>
    
    <script>
        //onclick will call the function of JS in button above
        //This is where we can write js code in html pages
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "This is chnaged due to JS";
        document.write(5 + 6); //This erases all the things so better not to use much 
        alert("Hello World!!") //window have global scope so instead of using window.alert() we can directly use alert()

        // types of variables in JS let,const &  var is also used
        { let a = 5; }  //normal variable can be reassigned and it have block scope
        let b = 10;
        //this variable can get type based on assigned value

        //must be declared before use

        const c = 18;  //as said we cannot reassign as this constant & it should have value while declaration
        var a=9;

        //but const arrays can be changed
        const cars = ["volvo", "BMW"];
        cars[0] = "Toyota";
        cars.push("Audi");
        //these operations are valid

        // cars=["1","2","3"] //this is not valid

        //Arithmatic Operators
        let x = 100;
        let y = x + 50;//+ addition Operator
        console.log(y); //will show in console of browser
        let z = x - 50;
        console.log(z);
        let d = 5 ** 2;  //this is exponential operator

        console.log(d);
